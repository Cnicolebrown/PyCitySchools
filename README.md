**Overview of School District Analysis**

The primary purpose of this analysis was to recalculate the math and reading scores, accounting for the academic disonhesty that occured in Thomas High School. The analysis compared the math and reading scores of various high schools ranging from different types. Some important key components of the analysis was the examination of scores, school type, budget, and size of school. This analysis should be used to aide in the distribution of future funding to schools based on need and performance.

When the math and reading scores of Thomas high school are replaced with Null values, there is a drop that is not statistically signifigant in the mean reading and math scores. This drop does not affect its ranking compared with the other high schools, and it still ranks second amont the top performing high schools. 

*Thomas High School Performace and the effect of 9th grade scores on other variables*
  ***Math and Reading scores by grade***
 One of the largest difference was the lack of available scores for 9th grade at Thomas high school. However this is due to the fact that these grades were disqualified, but aside from that there were not any other notable changes. 
  ***Scores by School Spending***
  The scores by school spending was also not greatly affected, Thomas high school was reclassified into a new higher category though. 
  ***Scores by School Size***
  This was not affected by the new analysis
  ***Scores by School Type***
  This was not affected by the new analysis. 
  
  The lack of affect observed is possibly due to the small margin of change that resulted from the new analysis results. 
  
**Summary**
While there were not many noticable changes in the summarys, the budget was changed. A new range was created for Thomas High school and it no longer fell in its previous category. The overall passing rate did drop however, again it was not significant to cause a dramatic change in resutls. The overall reading and path scores did change as well, but like the passing rate it was not signifigant to cause drastic changes.
